## Project Overview
This project aims to solve gender inequality in the Palmora group across its three (3) regions. It will also uncover patterns and disparities related to gender distribution, roles, promotion, compensation, and leadership representations that will guide Palmoria towards a more inclusive and equitable workplace.
### Data Source
The primary data is the Palmora group data, sent from the Incubator Hub, and mainly for the project.
### Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI (For data transformation and creating reports)
- Microsoft Excel
### Data Cleaning and Transformation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning, I performed the following action:
- Data loading into MS Excel
- Handled missing values
    - Renamed columns and created conditional columns
    - Assigned a generic gender status to employees who refused to disclose their gender.
    - Merged datasets.
- Data Cleaning and formatting.
    - Removed employees without salary and removed the "NULL" department
- Created and performed DAX (Measures) to calculate functions like average, count, etc. 
- Built dashboards for visualizations.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploring the data to answer the following questions.
- What is the gender distribution in the organization?
- The insights on rating based on gender
- For the salary structure, the department with the lowest salary and the highest salary?
- The gender with the lowest salary and the highest salary?
- The region with the lowest salary?
- Does Palmora Group meet the requirement to pay employees a minimum of $90,000?
- Employees who falls within the salary range of $10,000-$20,000?
### Key Performance Indicator
- The male had the highest number In the organization (485)
- For insights on gender, males had the highest salary.
- Based on the rating, males had an average rating, making them the highest.
- For Salary structure, male employees are the highest-paid staff with a sum of $14,000 while the females were the lowest-paid employees 
- Lagos region had the lowest salary rate of about $9,000
- The Palmora group does meet the requirements to pay staff members $90,000 but because the salary rate across genders and regions is poor, so it will affect the pay.
- The majority of the female employees fall within the salary range of $10,000-$20,000

### Key Observation 
Based on my observation;
- About 43 employees refused to disclose their gender, this could be because the company had no structure database management.
- Kaduna region had the highest number of employees, that's because the company is situated in the Northern part of the country.
- It's safe to say that some of the employees left because of gender inequality and improper documentation system.
- Females had the lowest rating across department and regions.
- Accounting department had the lowest number of female and Legal department had the highest number of males. 
- The bonus payment does not reflect on the actual performance rating, this could be that there is office politices.
- Kaduna region had the highest employee salary band, followed by Abuja and Lagos.
- Majority of the employees earn about 90000 and above of the salary
### Recommendation 
Based on the above observation, Iâ€™d recommend that Palmora HR should: 
- The CEO of Palmora should enforce a comprehensive gender equity policy that clearly defines expectations, processes, and accountability structures.
- There should be a team responsible for monitoring gender-related issues and driving inclusion initiatives across the company.
- The CEO should align salary structures to roles rather than individuals to reduce subjective bias and ensure fairness.
- There should be a mandatory training for all managers on workplace equity, bias recognition, and inclusive decision-making.
- The CEO should establish anonymous channels for employees to report discrimination or inequality concerns.
- There should be a measurable gender balance goals across all regions and departments with regular tracking.
### Conclusion 
Addressing gender inequality at Palmoria is key to restoring trust and ensuring long-term growth. By acting on data insights and fostering inclusivity, the company can rebuild its culture and reputation.
